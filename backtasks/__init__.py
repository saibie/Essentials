"""
Overview:
    A custom application of background tasks for Django 5.
    exec_back.py in the root path checks the existance of waiting background tasks at regular intervals,
    and executes them in the background.
    
Motivation:
    - I cannot find django-background-tasks5.
    - django-background-tasks4 occurs errors sometimes.
